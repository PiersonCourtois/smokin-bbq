          <p>Smokin' BBQ offers the best KC barbecue in the area with locally sourced foods
          and environmentally friendly packaging. The menu features high-quality, low-cost food options,
          including pulled pork, brisket, ribs, chicken, and even veggie options! On-site event catering
          is also available. The owner of the food truck, Billy Denzel (pictured right), started his venture
          in 2018 after inspired by his family's home cooked BBQ. He wanted to share this food and his
          passion for it with everybody in town, so he bought a food truck and the rest is history!
          Smokin' BBQ has been serving the local community for the past 4 years. We have held
          events, charities, and much more! We strive to serve the best barbecue in the area
          and we hope that you will continue to support Smokin' BBQ!

        <p>The grill was the starting point to our adventure. It is the most important
           place in our food truck and is where all the magic happens. Our state of the
           art equipment is what ensures our quality is the best that it can possibly be.
           Our grill goes up to a maximum of 500&#176; F, and gets cleaned daily. The
           beginning of great food comes from great ingredients and great equipment. If
           you are interested in learning more or want to become part of our team, head
           over to our contact page to get in touch! We look forward to hearing from you.
